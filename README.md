# Senior Thesis

Code for my Honors Senior Thesis where I conducted a quantitative analysis on a dataset of 500 self-collected responses in Qualtrics, exploring the relationship between immigration timing of Indian Americans and financial behaviors related to debt and risk aversion. I utilized R for hypothesis testing, empirical analysis, and data visualization, producing insights relevant to understanding financial decision-making patterns. The paper finds immigration year of participants does not have a measurable impact on how debt and risk averse they are.
